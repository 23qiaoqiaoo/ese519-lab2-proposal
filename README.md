## Proposal:
What I am thinking of building is a manual traffic control system. It is a simulation that is based on the real-life traffic light system to control the traffic.
After the pushbutton is on, the traffic system is triggered, and a sentence “The traffic system is on” will be displayed first. And the default LED color will be green , which means the cars and people could go. If the push button for changing to Red LED light is on, the Yellow LED light will be on first and continue for 10 seconds, the count of times will be displayed too. Then, the yellow LED will be turned off too while the red LED will be turned on. If the push-button for LED light changing is on again, the light will be turned to green again.
I think this is cool because it is possible to design LED displays in a more fantastic way based on this, such as a LED light show changing with the music or hand gesture. And I find the use of light shows is quite popular in decoration or festivals, bringing a happy mood to the audience who watched it. Also, it is a great way to show an old way to control the traffic manually.
Components needed:
3 LEDs with yellow, red and green light
A port expander for more GPIO pins
2 pushbuttons, one for LED change control, another for the operation of the system.
A breadboard 
3 330 Ohm resistors for 3 LEDs
Stemma QT connector
The RP 2040 microcontroller
